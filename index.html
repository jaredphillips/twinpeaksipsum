					<h3>Agent Cooper</h3>
					<p>
						Shortstack of griddlecakes, maple syrup, lightly heated
						and a slice of ham. Nothing beats the taste of maple
						syrup when it collides with ham. Audrey, there's something you'd like to tell me... Glastonbury! The legendary burial place of King
						Arthur. Harry, given their mutual connection to the Blue Book
						Project, I'm afraid Earle may have targeted the Major.
					</p>
					<p>
						Suddenly it was twenty-five years later. I was old,
						sitting in a red room. There was a midget in a red suit
						and a beautiful young woman who looked exactly like
						Laura Palmer. The little man told me my favorite gum
						was coming back in style and didn't his cousin look
						exactly like Laura Palmer?
					</p>
					<p>
						She was trembling with fear. Quaking, like an animal. I
						might even venture a guess to say that it was fear that
						killed her. And in the moment of her death ... I saw Bob.
						As if he'd slipped in through a crevice in time. Upon
						reflection, I believe there's a connection between his
						appearance and Josie's fear. He was attracted by it. He
						may even feed off it
					</p>

					<h3>Windom Earle</h3>
					<p>
						Eureka! Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head. It's
						fear! It's fear, Leo, that's the key!
						My favorite emotional state and all this time it's been
						staring me in the kisser. Leo, it's marvelous, a
						perfect fit. These night creatures that hover on the edge of
						our nightmares are drawn to us when we radiate fear, it's
						their bread and butter, a perfect symbiosis. And to gain
						entrance to their realm, a simple offering, the suffering of
						innocence, Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspect, you
						do not disappoint. Leo, look lively, victory is at hand.
						We know where the entrance is. We know when the lock
						appears and now we hold the key in our hands.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
						called the White Lodge. Fawns gamboled there amidst
						happy laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and
						laughter filled the air. When it rained it rained sweet
						nectar that paralyzed the heart with the desire to live
						one's life in truth and beauty. Generally speaking, a ghastly place reeking of virtue's sour smell, engorged with the whispered prayers of kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools young and old compelled to do good without reason. But, I am pleased to note, our story does not end in this place of saccharine excess.
					</p>
					<p>
						For there is another place, its opposite, of almost
						unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and
						vicious secrets. No prayers dare penetrate this frightful
						maw. Spirits there care not for good deeds and priestly
						invocations. They are as like to rip the muscle from
						our bones as greet you with a happy g'day. And, if
						harnessed, these spirits, this hidden land of unmuffled
						screams and broken hearts, will offer up a power so vast
						that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
						This place I speak of, is known as the Black Lodge. And
						I intend to find it.

					<h3>Donna and James</h3>
					<p>
						This whole town's coming apart. And somehow James thinks it's all his fault. First Laura, then Maddy. Or maybe he blames me, I don't know. Two people in love couldn't cause something like this, could they? I went out for a ride this morning. Buried the needle. The engine sounded like music, like hundreds of people singing some huge song. Donna, what the hell is going on?
					</p>
					<p>
						He could've killed you too. I feel stupid. Ashamed. After Laura died, everything happened so fast. It's hard to know exactly what to believe in. But when I saw you tonight I knew exactly what I believed. Did you? It's like if we could put our hearts together, and keep them that way forever, we'd be safe no matter what.
					</p>
					<p>
						Donna...? Don't hurt him. Please. Don't hurt him anymore. I called the police. They're coming. You'll never get away with this. Maybe? Maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow if we wash our hair. Think like that you could go crazy. What's done is done. The only way this won't came back to haunt us is if we keep quiet about what happened last night, because I can promise you that's what James is doing. Get the picture?

					<h3>The Log Lady</h3>
					<p>
						Sometime ideas, like men, jump up and say "hello". They introduce themselves, these ideas, with words. Are they words? These ideas speak so strangely. All that we see in this world is based on someone's ideas. Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. I can say it again. Some ideas arrive in the form of a dream.
					</p>
					<p>
						I carry a log...yes. Is it funny to you? It is not to me. Behind all things are reasons. Reasons can even explain the absurd. Do we have the time to learn the reasons behind the human being's varied behavior? I think not. Some take the time. Are they called detectives? Watch...and see what life teaches.
					</p>
					<p>
						My husband died in a fire. No one can know my sorrow. My love is gone. Yet, I feel him near me. Sometimes I can almost see him. At night when the wind blows, I think of what he might have been. Again I wonder: why? When I see a fire, I feel my anger rising. This was not a friendly fire. This was not a forest fire. It was a fire in the woods. This is all I am permitted to say.
